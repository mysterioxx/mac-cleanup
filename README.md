## ⚠️ macOS Warning: “App can’t be opened because the developer cannot be verified”

Since this app is not notarized by Apple (no paid developer certificate used), macOS may show a warning when you try to open it.

👉 To open it anyway:

1. Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll down to the message saying:  
   _“Mac Cleaner was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer”_
3. Click **“Allow Anyway”**
4. Re-run the app. This time, macOS will ask for confirmation — click **Open**

> This is safe to do. The app is signed with a local ad-hoc signature and contains no code from unknown sources.
